\title{Categorize Data by Retention Time (RT) Windows with Overlapping Intervals}
\usage{
categorize_by_rt_window(
  data,
  rt_col = "RT",
  mz_col = "mz",
  window_width = 2.5,
  overlap = 0.75
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing retention time (RT) and mass-to-charge ratio (mz) columns.}

\item{rt_col}{A character string specifying the column name for retention time (RT). Default is \code{"RT"}.}

\item{mz_col}{A character string specifying the column name for mass-to-charge ratio (mz). Default is \code{"mz"}.}

\item{window_width}{A numeric value specifying the width of each RT window. Default is \code{2.5}.}

\item{overlap}{A numeric value specifying the overlap between consecutive windows. Default is \code{0.75}.}
}
\value{
A data frame with an additional column \code{Window}, indicating the assigned window(s) for each observation.
}
\description{
This function applies a sliding window approach to categorize data based on
retention time (RT) with overlapping windows. Each data point can belong to
multiple windows based on the defined overlap.

# Example data
data <- data.frame(
  RT = c(1.0, 2.3, 3.7, 5.1, 6.8, 8.0),
  mz = c(100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350)
)

# Apply categorization
categorized_data <- categorize_by_rt_window(data, rt_col = "RT", window_width = 2.5, overlap = 0.75)
print(categorized_data)
