\title{Calculate m/z Differences within RT Windows and Detect Known Molecular Differences}
\usage{
calculate_mz_differences(
  data,
  mz_col = "mz",
  window_col = "Window",
  selected_groups = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing m/z values and RT windows.}

\item{mz_col}{Character. The column name in \code{data} that contains m/z values. Default is "mz".}

\item{window_col}{Character. The column name in \code{data} that defines RT windows. Default is "Window".}

\item{selected_groups}{Character vector. Specific molecular differences to detect. Default is NULL (uses all known differences).}
}
\value{
A data frame containing pairwise m/z differences and detected molecular matches.
}
\description{
This function calculates the pairwise m/z differences within retention time (RT) windows
and detects known molecular differences based on predefined values.
}
